    ***Welcome to the Battleship game***

This is a two player strategy game.
Either player may be human or AI (just a very basic AI, though).
Each player has a fleet of ships of configurable sizes placed on his game board.
The ships can be placed randomly by the computer or manually by the player, but never next to eachother.
Each player needs to guess the locations of the other player\'s ships.
The player to do this first wins the game.

So, pick a side and start shooting!
